    " Ans: In python,tuple is a collecton of ordered and immutable elements enclosed in parenthesis().\n",
    " Here are some it's characteristics.\n",
    "1.Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified. This means you cannot add, remove, or change any element in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered, which means that they have a specific position/index within the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Heterogeneous: A tuple can store elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Can be nested: A tuple can contain another tuple as an element, allowing you to create nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Indexed: The elements in a tuple can be accessed using their index position starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Iteratable: You can iterate over the elements of a tuple using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Hashable: Tuples are hashable, which means that they can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. This is because they are immutable and their contents cannot be changed."
