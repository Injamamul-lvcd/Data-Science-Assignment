    "### Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "#### Ans: In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. It defines the attributes and methods that all objects of the class will have.\n",
    "#### On the other hand,An object is real world entity,it has state and behaviour.It is an instance of a class, created by calling its constructor method. It represents a specific instance of the class and has its own set of attribute values.\n",

    "#### Let's take an example of a class called Person to explain this concept further. The Person class can have attributes like name, age, gender, and methods like talk(), walk(), eat(). We can create multiple objects of the Person class, each with their own set of values for the attributes.\n",
